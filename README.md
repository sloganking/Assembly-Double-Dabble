# Assembly-Double-Dabble
[Self teaching] Implementing the double dabble algorithm to be able to output numbers to the console.

This project was created with the intent of teaching myself assembly and learning more about low level CPU operations. All code is to be executed using the simulator found here:

https://schweigi.github.io/assembler-simulator/index.html

Documentation for the simulator can be found here

https://schweigi.github.io/assembler-simulator/instruction-set.html

## Instructions

paste project code from DoubleDabble.asm

https://github.com/SleepingFox88/Assembly-Double-Dabble/blob/master/DoubleDabble.asm

into the code section of the simulator

https://schweigi.github.io/assembler-simulator/index.html}

Under label "input" enter desired integer to be printed to the console.
